# Modeling Optional Objects

In this lesson, we will design a monad which represents an object that may or may not exist. We will use optional objects to simplify the domain models, and then combine them with TPL to model awaitable optional objects that are useful when working with infrastructure and UI.

## Preparing the Code

To run this lesson, checkout the branch named `lesson-branching-and-looping`:

```
git checkout lesson-branching-and-looping
```

This branch contains the starting code of the demonstration of emergent objects. Before running the initial demo, make sure to recreate the database:

```
cd .\Source\
dotnet ef database drop -f --project .\Bookstore\
dotnet ef database update --project .\Bookstore\
```

It is advisable to use `watch run` to keep the application running during the whole development:

```
dotnet watch run --project .\Bookstore\
```
