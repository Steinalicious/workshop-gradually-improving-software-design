# Using Specifications and Strategies

This is the final state of the application after applying specifications to query the database and strategies to transform the domain objects.

### Preparing the Code

To run this lesson, checkout the branch named `lesson-branching-and-looping`:

```
git checkout lesson-branching-and-looping
```

This branch contains the starting code of the demonstration of emergent objects. Before running the initial demo, make sure to recreate the database:

```
cd .\Source\
dotnet ef database drop -f --project .\Bookstore\
dotnet ef database update --project .\Bookstore\
```

It is advisable to use `watch run` to keep the application running during the whole development:

```
dotnet watch run --project .\Bookstore\
```
