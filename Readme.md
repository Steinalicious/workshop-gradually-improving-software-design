# Workshop: Gradually Improving Software Design

## Lesson 1: Understanding Emergent Objects

In this lesson, we will develop a fairly complex feature in a Web application. To complete the exercise, we will need to design many interconnected classes.

By the end of the exercise, you will learn how to let classes and objects *emerge*, so that they assume their responsibilities most naturally - and pleasantly! - as the design grows more complex.

## Lesson 2: Understanding Branching and Looping

In this lesson, we will develop a fairly complex feature in a Web application which consists of a significant number of branching and looping instructions.

By the end of the exercise, you will learn how to leverage polymorphism to avoid explicit branching, and such tools as LINQ or Composite pattern to remove looping from the domain-related code.
